This repository contains implementations for the "Electron/Photon Classification" common task and the specific "Task 2g" focused on next-generation vision transformers for end-to-end mass regression and classification.
Common Task: Electron/Photon Classification
This task involves distinguishing between electron and photon particles based on their signatures in detector data. The classification model aims to accurately identify particle types from sensor readings and derived features.
Specific Task 2g: Vision Transformers for Mass Regression and Classification

Documentation
This repository includes comprehensive documentation for both tasks:

Common Task Documentation: Explains the electron/photon classification methodology, data preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation metrics.
Specific Task 2g Documentation: Provides in-depth analysis of the vision transformer approach for mass regression and classification, including architectural innovations, training methodology, and performance benchmarks. 

Refer to the documents in the docs/ directory for detailed technical explanations of the codebase.
